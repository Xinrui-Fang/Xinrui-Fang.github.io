## About Me

I am a 2nd year PhD student specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Tokyo, under the supervision of [Prof.Koji Yatani](https://iis-lab.org/member/koji-yatani/).
My passion is to design critical AI tools that foster human's science communication and well-being. Previously I was working in the [Rakuten Group Inc](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/). as an Application Engineer for 2 years. Before that, I got my master degree from the [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/) under the supervision of [Prof.Yuta Sugiura](https://lclab.org/people/yutasugiura), and got my bachelar degree from the [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).
